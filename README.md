# LLM ASCII CAT GENERATION

All popular LLMs are pretty bad at generating ascii art, so I wanted to find out whether it's possible to improve the ascii generation capabilities using supervised finetuning. As a proof of concept, I trained a LORA adapter for Llama 3.2 3B to generate ascii art of cats.



```
   /\_/\
   >^.^<.---.
  _'-`-'     )\
 (6--\ |--\ (`.`-.
     --'  --'  ``-'BP
```

This project contains scripts to do the finetuning and inference of the resulting ascii cat adapter.


## Dataset

200 ascii cats:
- [Local (raw images)](src/dataset/ascii_art/animals/cat) 
- [Huggingface (train parquet)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pookie3000/ascii-cats)

Curated from:
- https://user.xmission.com/~emailbox/ascii_cats.htm
- https://www.asciiart.eu/animals/cats
- variations generated by ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, ...

Big shoutout to all ascii creators: jgs, snd, mrf and other anonymous artists.

## Supervised Finetuning
I wanted to finetune a model I could run locally but quantization seemed to mess with the generation of ascii art. I tried out multiple local llms but the best results were achieved with the [Llama-3.2-3B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B).

The finetuning was done using [Unsloth](https://unsloth.ai/blog/deepseekr1-dynamic) with the following notebook on google colab: [src/finetuning/google-colab/train.ipynb](src/finetuning/google-colab/train.ipynb).


Resulting ascii cat lora adapter (finetuned for 10 epochs):

## Inference

To generate new ascii cats using my trained lora adapter, you can use the following notebook which uses llama.cpp [src/inference/notebooks/llama_cpp_inference.ipynb](src/inference/notebooks/llama_cpp_inference.ipynb).

In order to run the notebook, you need to locally download both the llama3.2 3b gguf model and the ascii cat adapter in gguf format.

- [Llama-3.2-3B-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/pookie3000/Llama-3.2-3B-GGUF)
- [Llama-3.2-3B-ascii-cats-lora-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/pookie3000/Llama-3.2-3B-ascii-cats-lora-GGUF)

You also need to install the python dependencies using:

```
poetry install
```
